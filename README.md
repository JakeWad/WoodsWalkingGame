Spring 2023- Project Description

In this project, you will develop a computer simulation (ends up looking like a game, sort of). This simulation/game is meant to help K-8 students learn about computation, computational thinking, math concepts, and computer science.
The project will have 3 pieces:
a fairly simple visualization designed to show grades K-2 students the basic idea (and perhaps entertain them); students will make some choices, and see what develops
a slightly more complicated version in which grades 3-5 students make choices, see data, and meet additional challenges; we are aiming for grades 3-5 students to work with single data generating events, “small data”
a still more complex version for grades 6-8 in which students work with local and big data, graphs are generated, and students make judgments that change the data in meaningful ways; for this oldest group, we want to introduce the ideas of working with BIG data sets, interpreting something from multiple sources, over time
 
A big idea of this simulation is that students will have a similar look and feel to each of the three stages. When they encounter the second and third stages (as described above, K-2, 3-5, and 6-8) when they progress through their school years, the learning curve for the later stages will be shorter. Also, they can have more confidence that they will be successful at the new challenges.
The simulation is designed for a pair of students working together in front of the same screen. The simulation should include audio directions and prompts, and assessments to see how the students are doing with the challenges.
But what is the simulation about? That comes next
Wandering in the Woods Game:  People are “lost in the woods” where the woods are represented by a rectangular grid. The woods are dense, and the people can’t see or hear each other until they are in the same cell of the grid.
In grades K-2, the grids are always square, there are always two people, and they start out in diagonally opposite corners of the grid. They wander about randomly, and each move is counted, with a counter for each person. Music plays as cartoon characters wander in the woods. When the people bump into each other, there is a happy graphics display, and statistics from the wandering are displayed and announced audibly. Then the game is reset, and students can start it up again.
For grades 3-5, students can set up the size of a grid, which can be rectangular (instead of just square). There can be 2, 3, or 4 people, and students can place them wherever on their grid. Once the game is started, it can be played and replayed multiple times. Statistics (such as longest run without meeting, shortest run, and average run) are displayed.
If the game is played with 3 or 4 players, if two find each other, they will be moving together until they find the third player. In the same way, if the third player is found (assuming we have 4 players), the three players will move together until the fourth player is found
 
In grades 6-8, students have all the control of the 3-5 game, but 6-8 students will be challenged to run experiments to determine how the average run varies with the size and shape of the grids. They will also be able to explore different protocols for wandering, and to decide which is the best way to wander if you want to shorten the time it takes to meet up.
