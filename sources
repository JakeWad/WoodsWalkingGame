
ideas for "extra features":
    stat ups and downs: find a piece of candy +1 movement. bitten by a fox, lose your next turn
    random events: picked up by a tornado and returned to your starting location. find an old man looking for his dog
        find it and return to him to get a stat boost
    "dead zones", random chance for a button to not spawn forcing users to move around it
